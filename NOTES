gets and scanf in users validationa and in accounts validation difference due to comma and space 
"r": Read mode - The file is opened for reading.
"+": Update mode - The file is opened for both reading and writing.
so we use r+ to update and read

fread Function:

fread is a function in C used to read binary data from a file.
&acc - Address of the Variable:

&acc represents the memory address where the data read from the file will be stored.
acc is the variable of type accounts (presumably a struct).
sizeof(accounts) - Size of Each Element:

sizeof(accounts) calculates the size of one element of type accounts in bytes.
It provides the number of bytes needed to store the data structure.
1 - Number of Elements to Read:

1 specifies the number of elements (of size sizeof(accounts)) to read in a single operation.
accounts - File Pointer:

accounts is the file pointer pointing to the file from which data is being read.
== 1 - Check for Success:

The == 1 checks if fread successfully reads one element from the file.
If successful, the loop continues; if not, it exits.


In C, when you pass an array to a function, 
you should provide the array name without the square brackets.
The array name itself represents the address of the first element of the array.
Adding the square brackets is not syntactically correct and might lead to a compilation error.


%[abc]: Matches any character 'a', 'b', or 'c'.
%[^abc]: Matches any character except 'a', 'b', or 'c'.
So, %19[^\n] reads up to 19 characters until a newline character
