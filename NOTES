gets and scanf in users validationa and in accounts validation difference due to comma and space 
"r": Read mode - The file is opened for reading.
"+": Update mode - The file is opened for both reading and writing.
so we use r+ to update and read

fread Function:

fread is a function in C used to read binary data from a file.
&acc - Address of the Variable:

&acc represents the memory address where the data read from the file will be stored.
acc is the variable of type accounts (presumably a struct).
sizeof(accounts) - Size of Each Element:

sizeof(accounts) calculates the size of one element of type accounts in bytes.
It provides the number of bytes needed to store the data structure.
1 - Number of Elements to Read:

1 specifies the number of elements (of size sizeof(accounts)) to read in a single operation.
accounts - File Pointer:

accounts is the file pointer pointing to the file from which data is being read.
== 1 - Check for Success:

The == 1 checks if fread successfully reads one element from the file.
If successful, the loop continues; if not, it exits.
